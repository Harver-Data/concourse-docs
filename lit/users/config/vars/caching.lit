\title{Caching credentials}{creds-caching}

\use-plugin{concourse-docs}

By default, credentials are fetched each time they're used. When many
pipelines are configured this can result in a ton of requests to the
credential server.

To reduce load on your credential server you may want to enable caching by
setting the following env on the \reference{web-node}:

\codeblock{bash}{{{
CONCOURSE_SECRET_CACHE_ENABLED=true
}}}

By default, credentials will be cached for one minute at a time. This value can
be increased to further reduce load on the server like so:

\codeblock{bash}{{{
CONCOURSE_SECRET_CACHE_DURATION=5m # increase from 1m default
}}}

Credential cache duration can also determined by the credential manager itself -
for example, if Vault returns a lease duration for a credential, the shorter
value between the configured cache duration and the credential's lease duration
will be used.

By default, the \italic{absence} of a credential is also cached for 10 seconds
so that Concourse doesn't keep looking for a misconfigured credential. This
duration can be configured like so:

\codeblock{bash}{{{
CONCOURSE_SECRET_CACHE_DURATION_NOTFOUND=1s # decrease from 10s default
}}}
