When logging out just isn't enough, a target can be completely removed from
\code{~/.flyrc} by running:

\codeblock{bash}{{
$ fly -t example delete-target
}}

To delete \italic{all} targets, run:

\codeblock{bash}{{
$ fly delete-target -a
}}

Note: These two variations are mutually exclusive. If the target parameter
\code{-t} and all parameter \code{-a} are both specified, an error will
occur.
