Every now and then you just don't want a pipeline to be around anymore.
Running \code{fly destroy-pipeline} will stop the pipeline activity and remove
all data collected by the pipeline, including build history and collected
versions.

For example, to destroy the \code{my-pipeline} pipeline, you would run:

\codeblock{bash}{{
$ fly -t example destroy-pipeline --pipeline my-pipeline
}}
