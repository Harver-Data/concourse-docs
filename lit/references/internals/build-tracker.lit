The build tracker is the component that runs the execution of a build. It picks
up any started builds, which can be orphaned builds (builds that an ATC started
but did not finish) or builds that have just been scheduled. There is one build
tracker per ATC, which runs on an interval that is defaulted to 10 seconds.
