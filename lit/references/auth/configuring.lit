The very first thing to configure with Concourse is how users will log in, and
what those users should be able to do.

This is configured in two separate tiers:

\list{
  \bold{Authentication}, how users identify themselves, is configured on the
  \reference{web-node}.
}{
  \bold{Authorization}, how user access is determined, is configured on each
  team.
}

Concourse currently supports the following auth methods:

\table-of-contents

Any number of providers can be enabled at any one time. Users will be given a
choice when logging in as to which one they would like to use.

Concourse uses a fork of \link{Dex}{https://github.com/dexidp/dex} for its
authentication. You can find additional documentation on the supported auth
providers in the \link{Dex connectors
documentation}{https://github.com/dexidp/dex/tree/master/Documentation/connectors}.

Adding a new auth provider to Concourse is as simple as submitting a pull
request to our \link{fork of Dex}{https://github.com/concourse/dex} and then
adding a bit of configuration to the \link{\code{skymarshal}
component}{https://github.com/concourse/concourse/tree/master/skymarshal}.
