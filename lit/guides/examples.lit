Configuring self-contained Concourse \reference{pipelines}{pipelines} is a great
way to try things out before diving into the deeper content.

Each example contains a pipeline YAML snippet which can be copy-pasted to a
local file and configured on your instance via \reference{fly-set-pipeline}.
From there you may want to poke around and try changing parts of the
configuration to learn how things work. All the available knobs to turn are
covered in the \reference{guides}.
