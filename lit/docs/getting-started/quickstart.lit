\section{
    \title{Docker Compose Concourse}

    Concourse is distributed as a single \code{concourse} binary, making it easy to
    run just about anywhere, especially with Docker.

    If you'd like to get Concourse running somewhere quickly so you can start to
    kick the tires, the easiest way is to use our \link{docker-compose.yml}{docker-compose.yml}:

    \codeblock{bash}{{
    $ curl -O https://concourse-ci.org/docker-compose.yml
    $ docker-compose up -d
    Creating docs_concourse-db_1 ...
    Creating docs_concourse-db_1 ... done
    Creating docs_concourse_1 ...
    Creating docs_concourse_1 ... done
    }}

    Concourse will be running at \link{localhost:8080}{http://localhost:8080} on
    your machine. You can log in with the username/password as
    \code{test}/\code{test}.
}

\section{
    \title{Install Fly}

    Next, install the \reference{fly-cli} by downloading it from the web UI and
    \reference{fly-login}{login} to your local Concourse as the \code{test} user:

    \codeblock{bash}{{
    # MacOS
    $ curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/cli?arch=amd64&platform=darwin -o fly \\
        && chmod +x ./fly && mv ./fly /usr/local/bin/
    # Linux
    $ curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/cli?arch=amd64&platform=linux -o fly \\
        && chmod +x ./fly && mv ./fly /usr/local/bin/
    # TODO Windows powershell. How to PATH on windows???

    $ fly -t tutorial login -c http://localhost:8080 -u test -p test
    logging in to team 'main'

    target saved
    }}

    You'll notice that every \code{fly} command in this tutorial has to have the
    \reference{fly-targets}{target (\code{-t tutorial})} specified. This is
    annoying when you only have one Concourse to target, but it helps ensure you
    don't trigger a job on the wrong Concourse instance. It will save you from
    hurting yourself!

    Once you've confirmed everything is up and running by logging in through fly
    and the \link{web UI}{http://localhost:8080}, you can move onto the next
    section. If you refresh this page you should see the web UI in the frame below.
